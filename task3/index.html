          <div>Football Task: <br>
          Most football fans love it for the goals and excitement. You are to handle the referee's little notebook and count the players who were sent off for fouls and misbehavior.<br>
          The rules: Two teams, named "A" and "B" have 11 players each; players on each team are numbered from 1 to 11. Any player may be sent off the field by being given a red card. A player can also receive a yellow warning card, which is fine, but if he receives another yellow card, he is sent off immediately (no need for a red card in that case). If one of the teams has less than 7 players remaining, the game is stopped immediately by the referee, and the team with less than 7 players loses.<br>
          A card is a string with the team's letter ('A' or 'B'), player's number, and card's color ('Y' or 'R') - all concatenated and capitalized. e.g the card 'B7Y' means player #7 from team B received a yellow card.<br>
          The task: Given a list of cards (could be empty), return the number of remaining players on each team at the end of the game (as a tuple of 2 integers, team "A" first). If the game was terminated by the referee for insufficient number of players, you are to stop the game immediately, and ignore any further possible cards.<br>
          Note for the random tests: If a player that has already been sent off receives another card - ignore it.</div>
